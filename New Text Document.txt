# Kossel 25000 additions
This repository contains my own additions to jcrochol's newest delta frame concept at https://github.com/jcrocholl/25000.

## Sheet metal carriage
A carriage design for openbuild's 20x40 vslot and their line of V Wheels. All hardware available at http://openbuildspartstore.com/

## Build plate
A nice build plate covering the bottom triangle out to the brackets. It's sandwiched with cork and an airgap underneath the heater for thermal insulation.

As my frame is designed for 300 mm horizontals, this won't fit the - as it looks right now - go-to size defined by dc42 (see https://miscsolutions.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/building-a-large-delta-printer/)

This builds on my previous design for the mini kossel heated bed, with which I'm quite satisfied (https://github.com/parate/Mini-Kossel-Heatbed)

## Sheet metal effector
An all metal effector designed for magnetic rods and E3D's Chimera dual hotend (http://e3d-online.com/Chimera).
