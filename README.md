# Kossel 25000 additions
This repository contains my own additions to jcrochol's newest delta frame concept at https://github.com/jcrocholl/25000.

## Sheet metal carriage
A carriage design for openbuild's 20x40 vslot and their line of vroller's

## Build plate
A nice build plate covering the bottom triangle out to the brackets.

This builds on my previous design for the mini kossel heated bed, with which I'm quite satisfied (https://github.com/parate/Mini-Kossel-Heatbed)

## Sheet metal effector
An all metal effector designed for magnetic rods and E3D's Chimera dual hotend (http://e3d-online.com/Chimera).
