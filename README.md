# Kossel 25000 additions
This repository contains my own additions to jcrochol's newest delta frame concept at https://github.com/jcrocholl/25000.

Growing build log and further documentation on : [parate.ch/3d-printing](http://parate.ch/3d-printing)

## Metal parts

### Sheet metal corners
I modified the corners to accept M5 hardware only, removing a bunch of holes intended for M3 screws.

### Sheet metal carriage
A carriage design for openbuild's 20x40 vslot and their line of V Wheels. All hardware available at http://openbuildspartstore.com/

### Sheet metal effector
An all metal effector designed for magnetic rods and E3D's Chimera dual hotend (http://e3d-online.com/Chimera).

### Build plate
A nice build plate covering the bottom triangle out to the brackets. It's sandwiched with cork and an airgap underneath the heater for thermal insulation.

As my frame is designed for 300 mm horizontals, this won't fit the - as it looks right now - go-to size defined by dc42 (see https://miscsolutions.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/building-a-large-delta-printer/)

This builds on my previous design for the mini kossel heated bed, with which I'm quite satisfied (https://github.com/parate/Mini-Kossel-Heatbed)

## Plastic parts
Some parts of the printer still consist of plastic printed parts.

### Endstop
A nice little endstop holder for the small kind of endstop switches (Omron's subminiature range of switches, D2F). The cablings are guided through a tunnel, giving a clean look.

### Self- centering spindle
Can be mounted on any extrusion where you can fit M5 screws. This spindle is self- centering for spindle hole diameters from 20 - 55 mm.

### Chimera coldend monitor
A housing to mount a Dallas 1W temperature sensor on the E3D Chimera's coldend. Initially intended for active coldend- fan control. Since this is strongly discouraged by E3D, the sensor now serves as a mere monitor.
