# Print instructions

Due to the heavy load on spindle and the base, I recommend printing them in nylon. Mine are printed with Taulman bridge, and they're very tough and have just the right amount of flex

The arms however should be as rigid as possible, I printed them in PLA therefore.

Layer height: 0.1 mm, printed with a 0.4 mm nozzle
